# EnvPhys
These are the Python Notebooks for the PHY470/570 Environmental Physics projects. The file `toolkit.ipynb` needs to be filled out with the user data for the particular course and is helpful to distribute assignments. It works in the OSC classroom setup, and may or may not be a useful starting point for others.
The other files are the actual projects.Each project is designed to be completed by this class within a two-hour time period.

## General Orientation
A quick primer in how to use the relevant Python code

## Soilheat
Exploring a 1D Heat diffusion problem, in the context of the surface heat balance. What is the diurnal/annual cycle of heat deeper in the soil? Why is geothermal heat a potentially energy efficient solution, even if only using the soil layers a few meter (or less) below the surface?

## Climate
Constructing a very simple climate model. Inspired by MIT's Computational Thinking course

## Wet bulb temperature

## Diffusion
